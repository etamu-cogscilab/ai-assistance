We have a scrolling and it goes to new line. 
But what about when we fill it?
Does it scroll now?
It doesn't really seem to scroll well.
What is happenning.

We need to have the scroller stay on the bottom.
This is kind of ok, but I am not sure it works.
Should we change the text size?

Question>
What is this world coming too?
This is my question.
